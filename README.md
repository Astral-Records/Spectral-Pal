Spectral pal - a helping device, that is fixed above or under the screen measuring the distance between the user and computer. It's main function is to give auditory warning if the recommended minimum distance is not reached.  Some prototypes may include connection to the device's screen providing visual reminders.

Product's prototype is based on IR (infrared) sensor, Arduino UNO and uses C for coding. As alternatives in the final version special circuits can be used.

## Work in progress:
- Adding POMODORO reminders to your screen
- Reminder in cases a person is sitting too long infront of the screen
