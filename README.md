<h3> üìù Description:</h3>
<table style="width: 100%;">

     <td style="vertical-align: top; padding-left: 10px;">

   <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
       Spectral-Pal is a helping device fixed above or below a computer screen to measure the user's distance from the screen. Its main function is to give auditory warnings when the recommended minimum distance is not maintained.  Some prototypes may include connection to the device's screen providing visual reminders.

The prototype is based on C language and uses Arduino UNO and IR (infrared) sensor. As alternatives in the future versions, special circuits may be used.
